# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project is a React application that utilizes Redux for state management, styled-components for styling, and interacts with a backend through Axios for API calls. It features a dynamic UI for settings management, device information display, and report generation with print functionality.

## Key Features

- **Settings Management**: Users can initialize and update various settings related to reports, device configurations, and user preferences.
- **Device Information Display**: Displays detailed information about devices, including type, name, and a list of associated devices.
- **Report Generation**: Supports generating daily and weekly reports, with options to print the reports.

## Technical Details

### State Management

The application uses Redux Toolkit for state management, with slices for different features like settings, devices, and reports.

- **File Path**: `src/store/configureStore.tsx`

### Environment Variables

Configuration and initialization settings are managed through environment variables, allowing for flexible deployment and configuration.

- **File Path**: `src/env.tsx`

### Components

#### DeviceInfo

Displays information about a specific device, utilizing Redux for state access.

- **File Path**: `src/components/settings/view/DeviceInfo.tsx`

#### Settings Page

Allows users to configure various settings, with components for different setting types and a modal for print settings.

- **File Path**: `src/components/pages/Settings.tsx`

### API Integration

The application interacts with a backend server using Axios for fetching and updating settings, device information, and report data.

- **File Path**: `src/features/api/index.tsx`

### Styling

Styled-components are used throughout the application for styling, with a centralized theme and color set for consistency.

- **File Path**: `src/static/colorSet.tsx`

## Development

### Running the Application

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Set up the required environment variables in a `.env` file based on `src/env.tsx`.
3. Start the development server with `npm start`.

### Adding New Features

To add a new feature, such as a new settings category:

1. Create a new slice in `src/features/reducers` for state management.
2. Add the slice to the root reducer in `src/store/configureStore.tsx`.
3. Create new components for the UI in `src/components/settings`.
4. Update the API integration if necessary in `src/features/api`.

### Deployment

The application can be built for production with `npm run build` and deployed to any static hosting service or server capable of serving a React application.

## Libraries Summary

This project leverages several key libraries to build a robust and scalable React application:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing the core framework for the application's UI components.
- **Redux Toolkit**: An advanced state management library that simplifies storing and updating application state, used extensively for managing the app's data flow.
- **Styled-components**: A library for styling React components using tagged template literals, enabling dynamic styling and theming throughout the application.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend server, used for all API interactions within the app.

These libraries were chosen for their popularity, reliability, and the community support available, making them ideal choices for developing modern React applications.
